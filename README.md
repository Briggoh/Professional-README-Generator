# README Generator 

# Project Description 

As a part of my requirements for the UC Berkeley Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, I have developed an application that allows a user to easily produce a README file. Upon installation, the user is prompted with a number of questions relating to their project. After answering these questions, this software produces a README file that contains the information that the user has inputted.  


# Instructions
 
 After the software is properly installed (see usage and installation sections below), the user will have to first open their terminal. Upon running the "node index" command, they will be met with a number of questions pertaining to the content and context of their project. Of the questions include: 
1. “What is the title of your project?”
2. “What license does your project use?”
3. “Please provide a brief description of your project”
4. “What are the steps required to install your project?”
5. “What is the intended use of your project?”
6. “What guidelines must others follow in order to contribute?”
7. “How do you test this project?”
8. “What is your GitHub username? (For communication purposes)”
9. “What is your email? (For communication purposes)”

After answering these questions, the software will produce a well-organized README file based on the content that the user provided. Its really that easy!
## Preview:

Attached below is a video containing a demonstration of the software.

## Installation:

In order to install this software, the user must use the "git clone" function in their command line. Click the green "code" button located above the documents/folders to access the SSH key! 

## Usage:

In order to use this software, the user must run the "node index" command in their terminal. They will then be prompted to answer a number of questions. Upon completion of these questions, the file will be completed with the users answers! The generated README should then be visible as 'generatedREADME' with the rest of your files on the left-hand side of the page.

## Contributions:

Although a 3rd party's interest in helping me is always appreciated, I will not be accepting any contributions for this project. 
## Testing:

In order to test this app, first open the file in VS Code. Then, open the terminal and  change directory into the root folder ‘challenge-9-professional-README-generator’, and run ‘node index.js’. Answer the prompts and view the preview of the ‘generated-README.md’ with the rest of your files on the left-hand side of the page.
