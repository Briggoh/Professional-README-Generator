# README Generator 

# Project Description 

As a part of my requirements for the UC Berkeley Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, I have developed an application that allows a user to easily produce a README file. Upon installation, the user is prompted with a number of questions relating to their project. After answering these questions, this software produces a README file that contains the information that the user has inputted.
